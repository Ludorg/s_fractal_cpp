## Some history on this old code

This code was developed in 2004 and was part of an ambitious (and immodest) side project named __Sofia__. It intended to be a way for developing knowledge.

Its immodest introduction motto was (in french):

_Dans la seconde moitié du Ve siècle avant JC, les sophistes firent profession d'enseigner la sofia, c'est à dire tout ce qui rend l'homme plus habile, plus savant, plus vertueux. Philosophes, ils étudiaient la logique, les phénomènes célestes, remettant en question les idées reçues, éveillant les intelligences._

Which is translated in:

_In the second half of the 5th century BC, sophists made a profession of teaching sofia, that is, all that  makes man more skilful, more learned, more virtuous. Philosophers, they studied logic, celestial phenomena, questioning conventional wisdom, awakening intelligences._

Unconsciously and unrelatedly, Sofia is also the name of my beloved daughter, born in 2015.
